              "Full-Stack Developer",
              "UI/UX Designer",
            ],
            autoStart: true,
            loop: true,
            deleteSpeed: 70,

              "Developer",
              "Web Developer",
              "Front-End Developer",
              "Back-End Developer",
              "Full-Stack Developer",
              "UI/UX Designer",
            ],
            autoStart: true,
            loop: true,
            deleteSpeed: 70,
          }}
        />
      );
    }
